  <!--
    Note: The ShareReceiverActivity is added dynamically by the Expo config plugin
    (withAndroidShareReceiver.js) to the app's AndroidManifest.xml at build time.

    The plugin adds the activity with proper intent-filters for audio/* MIME types
    and configures the label and theme based on plugin options.

    This manifest is intentionally minimal - the config plugin handles the rest.
